/**
 * @title  RemessoExecutor
 * @notice Recurring, policy-bound remittances on Celo.
 *
 * The problem this solves: a sender wants to set up a remittance once and have
 * it run unattended, without handing anyone a spending key.
 *
 * The shape of the answer:
 *
 *   1. The sender calls `approve()` on the funding token (USDT) for this
 *      contract, then `createSchedule()` with a policy — destination, amount
 *      per run, minimum interval, floor exchange rate, expiry, run cap.
 *   2. Remesso's backend (the `executor`) calls `executeRun()` when a schedule
 *      is due. It supplies only a slippage bound. It cannot change the amount,
 *      the destination, the cadence, or anything else.
 *   3. Each run pulls exactly `amountIn` from the sender, swaps it to cNGN on
 *      Uniswap V3, and delivers straight to the schedule's destination.
 *
 * What the executor CANNOT do, by construction:
 *   - send to any address other than the one the sender fixed at creation
 *   - move more than `amountIn` per run, or run more often than `interval`
 *   - accept a worse rate than the sender's `minRateE6` floor
 *   - keep running after `expiresAt` or past `maxRuns`
 *   - touch a schedule the sender has paused or cancelled
 *
 * The sender's ERC20 allowance is the outermost cap and is revocable at any
 * time without our cooperation. The contract custodies nothing: funds move
 * from sender to destination inside a single transaction.
 *
 * @dev V4 adds three things and keeps the contract immutable. Every owner
 *      setting below is PINNED INTO THE SCHEDULE at consent, so changing one
 *      can never alter a remittance somebody already authorised — the same
 *      rule V2 introduced for `poolFee`, applied to everything new.
 *
 *      1. `tokenOut` per schedule, from an owner allowlist. The swap rails are
 *         no longer hardwired to cNGN: a sender can be paid in any allowed
 *         asset, which is what makes a corridor other than naira possible
 *         without redeploying.
 *      2. `runNow` — a payment can be TRIGGERED early, by the sender or by an
 *         address the sender nominates, up to a number of early sends they
 *         authorise at consent. It changes nothing else: same destination,
 *         same amount, same floor, same run cap, same expiry. This is what
 *         lets another app, or an agent, ask Remesso to pay rather than only
 *         watch it pay.
 *      3. A commission, in basis points, capped at MAX_FEE_BPS in code and
 *         pinned per schedule. Taken from the funding amount before the rail
 *         runs, paid to `treasury`. A sender sees the exact rate they are
 *         agreeing to, and no later owner action can raise it on them.
 *
 * @dev V3 adds a second rail. `Direct` forwards the funding asset itself with
 *      no swap: the sender funds in USDT, USDC or cUSD and the recipient
 *      receives that same asset. There is no conversion, so no floor rate, no
 *      slippage, no pool and no dependency on the single cNGN venue.
 *
 *      This exists because MiniPay — the wallet this product targets — displays
 *      only USDm (cUSD), USDC and USDT. A recipient paid in cNGN sees nothing,
 *      and MiniPay has no custom-token import. The swap rails remain for bank
 *      payouts, where the recipient never touches a wallet.
 *
 *      Note the assets differ in decimals: USDT and USDC are 6dp, cUSD is 18dp.
 *      The contract is decimal-agnostic (it moves `amountIn` base units), but
 *      anything formatting these values is not.
 *
 * @dev V2. Changes from the deployed V1 (0xC7eF75fC…1189), all from the
 *      2026-09-14 security review:
 *
 *      - The swap now lands in this contract and is forwarded with an explicit
 *        `safeTransfer`. V1 paid the recipient straight from the Uniswap pool,
 *        which made the POOL the cNGN sender-of-record — and cNGN only burns
 *        (its signal to pay naira) when the transferor is on its
 *        external-sender whitelist. A public pool is not and cannot be, so
 *        every bank payout would have silently never paid out.
 *      - Delivery is asserted on the recipient's measured balance delta, not
 *        on the router's self-reported return value.
 *      - `destination` rejects the router's MSG_SENDER/ADDRESS_THIS sentinels.
 *      - The floor is validated at creation, not merely `minRateE6 != 0`.
 *      - `poolFee` is pinned per schedule at consent time.
 *      - Schedules must expire, and the sender can refresh their floor.
 *      - `renounceOwnership` is disabled.
 *
 * @dev Destination is deliberately immutable. For wallet payouts it is the
 *      recipient's address. For bank payouts it is the cNGN redemption address
 *      the sender consented to at setup — the bank details themselves live off
 *      chain, in the cNGN API. Changing where money goes requires cancelling
 *      and creating a new schedule, which is the point.
