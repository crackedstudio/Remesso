/// A paid endpoint that asks Remesso to send a payment now.
///
/// This is the part that makes Remesso callable rather than only watchable. An
/// app, a person or another agent pays a cent in USDC over x402 and one run of
/// a schedule fires ahead of its cadence. No account, no API key, no invoice —
/// the payment IS the authentication.
///
/// What it cannot do, and this is the whole design:
///   - it cannot choose the destination, the amount, the asset or the rate
///   - it cannot run a schedule whose sender did not nominate this executor as
///     its trigger, and did not authorise early sends
///   - it cannot exceed the run cap, the expiry, the floor, or the sender's
///     ERC20 allowance
///
/// The caller is buying timing. Everything else was fixed when the sender
/// signed, and `runNow` re-checks all of it on-chain.
///
/// Order of operations: verify the payment, run, then settle. A caller whose
/// run reverts is not charged; a caller who is charged got their run.
