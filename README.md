# Remesso

Automated recurring stablecoin remittances on **Celo**.

A sender authorises a remittance once — recipient, amount, cadence, expiry,
and a floor rate if anything is being converted. It then runs unattended. No
one holds the sender's keys, and no one can move their money outside the
envelope they signed: the contract enforces it, not our code.

Today it pays in **stablecoins** — the recipient receives USDT, USDC or cUSD,
the assets MiniPay actually displays. The naira rails (cNGN to a wallet, or
through the cNGN API to a Nigerian bank account) are built and tested but
**switched off in the UI** pending the regulatory work described under
[Open items](#open-items). Everything about them below still holds; nothing
about them is reachable by a sender right now.

Three things distinguish it from a scheduled transfer script:

- **The contract is the authority.** A backend key triggers runs and can do
  nothing else — not redirect, not raise an amount, not outlive an expiry.
- **It is callable.** An agent, an app or a person can pay a cent over
  [x402](#being-callable) to move a payment forward, inside the same envelope.
- **It is a verified agent.** Registered with Self Agent ID against a real
  passport, so the thing moving money has a proof-of-human binding rather than
  being an anonymous key.

## Why Celo and cNGN

The original plan targeted moove.xyz. That does not work, and the reason is
structural rather than a matter of timing: Moove's entire public API is two
payment-link endpoints, and its stated design principle — repeated across their
docs and enforced in their key model — is *"no endpoint moves funds."* Money in
is programmable; money out is not. Moove Ramp is additionally first-person only,
so a third party can never trigger a recipient's payout.

Celo is a public blockchain, so there is no permission to ask. cNGN is a
Nigerian-SEC-regulated naira stablecoin that deployed to Celo in August 2026,
and its API does the thing Moove's cannot: `redeemAsset` burns cNGN and pays
naira to an arbitrary bank account.

Everything below was verified on-chain and against live docs, most recently
2026-09-22.

**V4 is deployed but nothing points at it.** Schedules live in a contract's own
storage, so moving is a migration, not an upgrade: every sender must approve the
new address and re-create their schedule. V4 adds a payout asset per schedule,
`runNow`, and a capped commission — see [V4](#v4-what-changed).

                                    x402 facilitator settles, pays gas
```

Everything on the money path is deterministic: pg_cron decides *when*,
`runnability()` decides *whether*, and the contract decides *what*. The parts
that are not deterministic — the assistant, the identity check — sit at the
edges and cannot move a cent.

### The authorisation model

The sender signs **one on-chain transaction**, not a session key. MiniPay — the
wallet most of this audience actually uses — does not support message signing at
all, so an off-chain permission grant was never viable. An `approve` plus a
`createSchedule` call is also better: it is explicit, auditable, and revocable
by the sender without our cooperation.

What the backend's hot key can do: call `executeRun(id, minOut)`.
What it cannot do, enforced in the contract rather than in our code:

- send to any address except the one the sender fixed at creation
- move more than `amountIn`, or run more often than `interval`
- accept a rate below the sender's `minRateE6` floor
- run after `expiresAt` or past `maxRuns`
- touch a paused or cancelled schedule

The sender's ERC-20 allowance is the outermost cap. Revoking it stops
everything, immediately, with no involvement from us.

### Why bank payouts settle in two steps

`redeemAsset` returns a deposit address; cNGN is then sent there and naira is
paid out. So an `ngn_bank` run goes `pending → swapping → redeeming → paid_out`,
and only the `redemption.completed` webhook advances the last step. A run whose
swap has settled has **not** delivered cash — showing a sender "settled" at that
point is the failure mode this schema is shaped to prevent.

---

## V4: what changed

Deployed 2026-09-22, **unaudited**, and not yet carrying any schedule. Three
additions, each *pinned into the schedule at consent* so no later owner action
can reach a remittance somebody already signed:

- **A payout asset per schedule**, from an owner allowlist. The swap rails were
  hardwired to cNGN at deployment, which made every new corridor a redeploy.
- **`runNow`** — an early send, callable by the sender or by an address they
  nominate, bounded by a number of early sends they authorise, a 60-second gap,
  and every limit they signed. Default is zero: a V4 schedule behaves exactly
  like a V3 one unless its sender opts in.
- **A commission**, in basis points, capped at `MAX_FEE_BPS = 50` in code. The
  floor is measured against the *net* amount, because a floor is a rate —
  charging it on the gross would tighten the sender's floor by the fee.

54 tests across the four contract suites. Most of the V4 ones are the same shape
twice: the owner changes a setting, and a schedule already authorised does not
move.

## Being callable

`trigger-run` sells one early send over **x402**. An agent POSTs a schedule id,
gets a `402` carrying the exact price, retries with a signed USDC authorisation,
and one run fires ahead of its cadence. No account and no API key — the payment
is the authentication, which is why `verify_jwt = false` on that function.

The caller buys **timing and nothing else**. Destination, amount, asset, floor,
run cap and expiry were fixed when the sender signed, and `runNow` re-checks
every one on-chain. A schedule whose sender never nominated our executor is
refused with `403` before any price is quoted — nobody should pay to discover
that.

Order is **verify → run → settle**: a run that reverts charges nobody, and a
settlement that fails after a successful run is logged as our loss rather than
retried against a caller who already got what they paid for.

Proven on mainnet 2026-09-22: one request moved 0.01 USDC to the treasury and
0.1 USDT to a recipient
([run](https://celoscan.io/tx/0x630e46810088704a7d43d2cfb8d545f7c7a85ee3bde6e0658e814eeb70377e98),

`scripts/x402-buy.ts` is the buyer half, if you want to try it.

## Identity

Two separate things, both optional to the money path:

- **Senders** can verify with [Self](https://self.xyz) from the home screen: a
  Pre-KYC flow (OFAC screening, 18+) proved from a passport, zero-knowledge, no
  personal data stored. It **gates nothing** — that was a decision, not an
  omission. Making it a gate means a check in `execute-due-runs`.
- **Remesso itself** is registered as a Self Agent ID (token `191`), soulbound
  to the cold owner wallet. That is what makes the agent sybil-resistant rather
  than an anonymous key, and it is the Work-tier requirement for Celo's Agent
  Visa.

MiniPay cannot open the Self app directly — its webview blocks the handoff and
falls through to the App Store, losing the request. The app therefore asks the
sender to copy the link into Chrome or Safari. Verified on device.

## The assistant layer

Two providers, neither of which can move money.

**DeepSeek** turns a sentence into a draft schedule the sender edits and signs.
**TypeSafe (Jev)** answers typed questions — a label and a probability, never
prose — and does three jobs: classifying a failure reason, flagging fields a
draft read ambiguously, and scoring how unusual a schedule is before it is
signed.

The rule that matters: **no model writes the words a sender reads about a
payment.** `classify_run` returns one of our categories and `web/lib/failures.ts`
holds the sentence. Reasons the backend writes itself are matched by regex
first; Jev is asked only about the tail, and only above 0.6 confidence.

## Attribution

Every transaction Remesso causes carries the Celo attribution suffix
(ERC-8021, code `remesso`) — the executor's runs and each wallet write a sender
signs. Celo's reward distribution reads this data and **untagged transactions
cannot be claimed retroactively**. First tagged transaction: 2026-09-22.

## The indexer

A Goldsky instant subgraph over the executor gives the UI a run within seconds
of its block, instead of waiting for the backend write plus a 15-second poll.
It is advisory: `web/lib/history.ts` merges it with the `runs` table, and
without it the history is simply the database. See `indexer/README.md`.

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in secrets; never commit this

cd contracts
forge install                 # forge-std + openzeppelin
forge test                    # 54 passing across V1-V4

# Deploy to testnet FIRST and run a full schedule end to end there.
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x... EXECUTOR_ADDRESS=0x... \
  forge script script/DeployV4.s.sol:DeployV4 --rpc-url celo_sepolia --broadcast

cd ..
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy execute-due-runs cngn-webhook reconcile-redemptions \
  cngn-proxy balance-poller ai-assist self-verify self-webhook trigger-run
supabase secrets set --env-file .env.functions
```

`.env.functions`, not `.env`: Supabase injects `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` itself and rejects them as reserved, failing the
whole command. `TESTING_*` is excluded too — those hold a funded wallet key used
only by the local e2e script, and shipping a spendable key into a deployed
environment for no reason is how blast radius grows quietly.

```bash
grep -vE '^(SUPABASE_(URL|ANON_KEY|SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)|TESTING_)' .env \
  | grep -E '^[A-Z0-9_]+=' > .env.functions
```

Everything optional degrades to silence rather than an error. Without
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` there is no draft-from-a-sentence; without
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` failures are still classified by rules; without `SELF_*`
the verify card never appears; without `X402_*` paid triggering answers 503;
without `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOLDSKY_SUBGRAPH_URL` the history is the database alone.
`scripts/check-env.ts` says which of these you have.

Set the cron vault secrets once, so the service-role key never sits in a cron
definition in plain text:

```sql
select vault.create_secret('https://<ref>.supabase.co', 'project_url');
select vault.create_secret('<service-role-key>',        'service_role_key');
```

Point the cNGN dashboard's webhook URL at
`https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/cngn-webhook` and set the signing
secret to `CNGN_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Configure the test URL and verify against
sandbox transactions before touching the live one.

**Enable anonymous sign-in** before the frontend will work at all: Supabase
Dashboard -> Authentication -> Sign In / Providers -> Anonymous sign-ins. It is
off by default, and `ensureSender()` calls `signInAnonymously()` on every wallet
connection — MiniPay cannot sign messages, so SIWE is not available to this
audience. Without it every request fails with
`422 anonymous_provider_disabled`, which surfaces as a frontend that silently
shows no schedules.

Then the sender app:

```bash
cd web
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # public config only; no cNGN secrets here
npm install
npm run dev
```

`web/.env.local` holds nothing sensitive by design. The cNGN API key, AES key
and Ed25519 private key exist only as Supabase secrets, reachable through the
`cngn-proxy` Edge Function — the docs are explicit that they must never reach
client-side code, and cNGN whitelists by IP, so one egress point is also the
only arrangement that can be whitelisted at all.

---

## Liquidity: the live constraint

There is exactly **one** cNGN venue on Celo — the Uniswap V3 pool above. It
holds roughly 118M cNGN and 95k USDT. Measured via QuoterV2 on 2026-09-07:

| Trade | Slippage |
|---|---|
| $100 | 0.005% |
| $1,000 | 0.055% |
| $2,500 | 0.14% |
| $5,000 | 0.27% |
| $10,000 | 0.55% |

Re-measured via QuoterV2 on 2026-09-14: the pool held 93,611 USDT and 119.6M
cNGN, and spot was ₦1,369.28/USDT. `liquidityIsHealthy` aborts above 150bps,
which this pool does not reach until roughly $27–30k.

Spot was ₦1,368/USDT, sitting sensibly between the official NFEM rate (₦1,329)
and the parallel market (₦1,395–1,410).

For remittance-sized transfers this is effectively free. Two consequences are
baked into the code:

1. `LIMITS.maxRunAmountUsdt` caps a single run well below the point where
   slippage bites, and `liquidityIsHealthy()` aborts a run the pool cannot fill
   cheaply rather than executing it at any price.
2. **About 76% of all cNGN on Celo sits in that one pool.** One LP withdrawal
   removes the entire swap route. Treat the swap as a replaceable component:
   Textile FX (OTC, 78 onboarded Nigerian firms) is the venue for size, and
   minting cNGN directly through ASC is the endgame. Do not let the Uniswap call
   leak beyond `_shared/celo.ts`.

---

## The cNGN integration

Implemented against the published spec at `docs.cngn.co`, not against
assumptions. Four properties of that API drive the code:

**Requests are encrypted, responses are sealed.** POST and PUT bodies go out as
`{content, iv}` — AES-256-CBC under a key derived by SHA-256'ing the dashboard
encryption key. Every *successful* response comes back as
`{status, message, data}` where `data` is a base64 libsodium `crypto_box`
sealed to your Ed25519 public key: `nonce(24) || ciphertext || ephemeral pk(32)`.
It is an opaque string on the wire, so reading a field off it without opening it
first silently yields `undefined`.

`supabase/functions/_shared/cngn.test.ts` verifies both directions against the
docs' own reference implementations — our AES ciphertext is byte-identical to
what Node's `createCipheriv` produces, and the tests play the role of the cNGN
server, sealing payloads to a freshly generated `ssh-keygen` key and requiring
the client to open them. Run it with:

```bash
deno test --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run --allow-net \
  supabase/functions/_shared/cngn.test.ts
```

**The rate limit is 20 requests per 60 seconds per API key, and breaching it
blocks the key for another 60 seconds.** That makes the limiter in `cngn.ts` a
correctness feature rather than politeness: one burst of bank-list lookups from
a signup page would otherwise strand an in-flight redemption. Banks and networks
are cached for six hours in the Edge Function and again for twelve in the Next
route handler, which is what the docs advise.

**Webhooks are delivered exactly once.** *"Deliveries are sent once, with a
10-second timeout, and are not automatically retried."* A 500 from us — a cold
start, a deploy landing mid-delivery — loses the event permanently and leaves a
run stuck in `redeeming` while the recipient has in fact been paid. So
`cngn-webhook` persists and acknowledges before doing any work, and
`reconcile-redemptions` polls `/transactions` every ten minutes for anything
still open. The webhook is the fast path; the transactions API is the authority.

**Only four endpoints are on the money path**, and they are deliberately split
by who can reach them:

| | Reachable from | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /banks` | `cngn-proxy` (signed-in senders) | Cached hard; ~900 rows |
| `POST /account/verify` | `cngn-proxy` (signed-in senders) | At onboarding only, never at payout |
| `POST /redeemAsset` | `execute-due-runs` only | Requires the "Redeem" permission |
| `GET /transactions` | `reconcile-redemptions` only | Settlement of record |

Note the path is `/account/verify`, not `/verifyAccountDetails` — an earlier
draft of this repo had the latter, which does not exist.

---

## Getting cNGN credentials

Everything below comes from the merchant dashboard, and **each environment has
its own complete set**. A `cngn_test_` key with a live encryption key fails; so
does a live key against the SSH key you uploaded for test.

1. **Onboard as a merchant.** Sandbox access needs an account. Live keys are
   issued only after KYB completes: business documents, identity verification
   for account owners, and the onboarding fee. This gates the entire live path,
   so start it early — it is not a same-day step.

2. **API key and encryption key.** Dashboard → **Settings → API Key**. Both are
   already generated; reveal with the eye icon and copy with the clipboard icon.
   The prefix picks the environment (`cngn_test_…` / `cngn_live_…`); the base
   URL is the same either way.
   → `CNGN_API_KEY`, `CNGN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

3. **Ed25519 keypair — you generate this, not cNGN.**

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "api@remesso" -f cngn_api_key
   ```

   Paste `cngn_api_key.pub` into the **SSH public key** field on the same tab.
   Keep the private half. Without it every request fails with
   `No Test SSH Key found`, and nothing the API returns is readable.
   → `CNGN_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` (the private half; escaped `\n` is fine)

   **Take the default of no passphrase.** cNGN's guide offers one, but the
   executor runs unattended and has nothing to prompt with — a passphrase
   encrypts the key body and the private key cannot be loaded at all. If you
   already set one, strip it; the public key is unchanged, so the dashboard
   needs no update:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -p -N "" -f cngn_api_key
   ```

   The four ways this goes wrong — passphrase, the `.pub` file pasted instead
   of the private half, an RSA key, and a truncated paste — each fail with a
   message naming the actual problem rather than a generic parse error. They
   are covered in `cngn.test.ts`, because the failure they'd otherwise produce
   is an unexplained key mismatch hours later.

4. **Permissions.** An organisation admin grants these per key. Remesso needs
   **Redeem**. Without it `redeemAsset` returns `{"status": false, "message":
   "Permission denied"}` — note that shape: the HTTP status is not the whole
   story, which is why the client checks both.

5. **IP whitelist.** Dashboard security settings. See below — this is the part
   that does not have a clean answer yet.

6. **Webhook signing secret.** Dashboard → webhooks. Set the URL to
   `https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/cngn-webhook` and subscribe to
   `redemption.completed` and `transaction.failed` at minimum.
   → `CNGN_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

```bash
# Prove the credentials before wiring anything up. /balance needs no request
# encryption, so a 200 here means the key, the IP and the SSH key are all good.
curl -s -X GET "https://api.cngn.co/v1/api/balance" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CNGN_API_KEY"
```

The `data` field of that response will be an unreadable base64 string. That is
correct — it is sealed to your public key.

### cNGN egress: the IP whitelist problem

cNGN checks the source IP of every request against a dashboard whitelist and
answers `403 IP address not whitelisted` regardless of credentials. Supabase
Edge Functions run on a large, dynamic pool of addresses, so **there is nothing
stable to whitelist.** This is a deployment blocker for the live environment,
not a code problem, and it has three possible answers:

**cNGN confirmed 2026-09-10: static IP only, no CIDR.** That settles it — there
is no arrangement under which Supabase's rotating egress can be whitelisted, so
cNGN traffic has to leave from one fixed address.

1. **A fixed-IP forward proxy — the recommended path.** Set
   `CNGN_EGRESS_PROXY_URL` and `cngn.ts` routes every cNGN call through it,
   throwing a clear error rather than silently going direct if the runtime
   cannot. Verified 2026-09-10 that the Supabase Edge Runtime
   (supabase-edge-runtime-1.76.0, Deno 2.1.4) does expose
   `Deno.createHttpClient` and accepts a proxy config, so this works without
   moving anything. A small VPS running tinyproxy, a Fly.io machine with a
   dedicated IPv4, or a managed static-IP proxy all satisfy it.
2. Move the cNGN-touching functions onto a host that has a static egress IP.

The 403 was reproduced directly: `GET /balance` with the live key returns
`{"status":403,"message":"IP address not whitelisted"}`, and an empty IP Access
List blocks everything rather than allowing everything.

## Open items

- **Regulatory posture — unresolved, and the reason the naira rails are off.**
  `redeemAsset` puts Remesso in the business of instructing naira payouts to
  third parties. That is a money-transmission question and it needs a Nigerian
  fintech lawyer before it goes near real senders. Until then the product ships
  **stablecoin-only** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_CNGN_RAILS` is not `"1"`), which
  needs no payout partner, no cNGN API and no licence answer. Nothing is
  deleted: the contract keeps all three rails and existing schedules of any
  kind still render.
- **V4 is unaudited.** It is deployed and was exercised once on mainnet, but no
  audit has been run, and it holds spending authority the moment a sender
  approves it. Audit before migrating anyone.
- **The V3 → V4 migration is not started.** The app, the executor and every
  live schedule are on V3. Moving means each sender approves the new address
  and re-creates their schedule; there is no carry-over.
- ~~**BANK PAYOUTS CANNOT WORK ON THE DEPLOYED CONTRACT.**~~ **Fixed in V2 and
  deployed in V3.** The original defect, found in the 2026-09-14 review: cNGN
  only burns when `isExternalSenderWhitelisted(msg.sender)`, and a Uniswap swap
  makes the **pool** the transferor, so a bank run would debit the sender, emit
  `RunExecuted`, pass both slippage guards and never pay naira. V2 onwards swaps
  to itself and forwards with an explicit `safeTransfer`, making one
  whitelistable address the sender-of-record. **cNGN must still whitelist the
  live executor address** before a transfer from it will burn — and a new
  deployment is a new sender-of-record, so V4 needs its own whitelisting.
- **Redemption-address stability — unanswered by cNGN.** `redeemAsset` returns
  a deposit address *per redemption*, while the contract fixes `destination` at
  authorisation. Two guards exist: `execute-due-runs` compares the address cNGN
  returns against the on-chain destination and aborts *before spending gas* if
  they differ, and the UI hides bank payouts entirely. If it does rotate, the
  envelope needs a sender-approved allowlist rather than one address.
- **cNGN account is not verified.** ₦100,000 plus KYB, and `redeemAsset` does
  not work until it completes.
- **The IP whitelist needs a fixed-IP proxy standing up.** cNGN will not
  whitelist a CIDR, and Supabase egresses from the whole AWS `eu-central-1`
  pool — measured: 8 consecutive calls, 8 distinct IPs.
- **Sender identity is a claim, not a proof.** MiniPay does not support message
  signing, so SIWE is unavailable and the app binds a wallet to an anonymous
  Supabase session. This does not weaken the money path — the contract checks
  `msg.sender`, and nothing in the database can move funds — but
  `senders.wallet_address` is first-come, so an address can be squatted. Self
  verification proves a *human*, not wallet ownership; it does not close this.
- **The `remesso` attribution code is not yet credited** on Celo's dashboard.
  Tagging works regardless; crediting is a registry step with the Celo team.
- **Not yet listed in MiniPay.** Listing pins the exact contract addresses,
  method signatures and URLs submitted — so submit after the V4 migration, not
  before, or every call breaks in production on a build that works elsewhere.
- Recipient notifications — one seam left in `balance-poller`.
